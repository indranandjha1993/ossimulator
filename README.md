# OSSimulator

OSSimulator is a project that aims to simulate an operating system environment with process management, process synchronization, memory management, and file system functionalities. It provides a platform for understanding and experimenting with various operating system concepts.

## Features

- Process management: Simulates process scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin. Manages process execution and context switching.
- Process synchronization: Implements process synchronization mechanisms such as semaphores or mutexes to coordinate access to shared resources.
- Memory management: Simulates memory allocation, paging, and virtual memory. Handles memory hierarchy and page faults.
- File system integration: Implements a simple file system module for file organization, directory structures, and basic file operations.
- Input/Output management: Manages I/O devices, device controllers, and implements disk scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SCAN, or C-SCAN.
- User interface: Provides a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the simulated operating system. Allows users to create processes, manage process execution, and monitor system resources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go programming language (version X.X.X)
- Other dependencies...

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/indranandjha1993/ossimulator.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd ossimulator
   ```
   
3. Build the project:

   ```shell
   cd ossimulator
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```shell
   ./ossimulator
   ```

### Usage
- Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the simulated operating system.
- Use the provided commands to create processes, specify their attributes, manage process execution, and monitor system resources.
- Experiment with different scheduling algorithms, process synchronization techniques, memory management configurations, and file system operations.
